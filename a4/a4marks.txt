MARKS
Total: 98/100

Compiles and Runs (5%)
[5/5] Compiles and runs

Basic Application (15%)
[5/5] Basic elements are present: window with a titlebar, score and play area.
[5/5] The score is displayed in the titlebar, and updates as fruit is sliced. A reasonable scoring mechanism is utilized.
[5/5] Fruit, screen and game elements are reasonable for the screen resolution (i.e. NexusOne).

Physics and Animation (30%)
[10/10] Fruit is created off-screen and animated up from the bottom of the screen.
[10/10] Fruit will rise up to roughly mid-screen, then descend and drop off-screen. This animation should be smooth. A simple animation is fine if it meets this basic objective.
[5/5] Multiple pieces of fruit are shown and animate on the screen at the same time.
[5/5] Performance is 'reasonable', game is playable in the AVD.

Interaction (35%)
[10/10] Dragging the mouse across a piece of fruit causes the fruit to be sliced. Failing to intersect the fruit will not slice anything or having any other effect. 
[10/10] Slicing a fruit causes 2 new pieces of fruit to replace the original piece.
[10/10] Fruit is sliced along the intersection line, and the shape and size of the resulting sub-pieces match the intersection.
[5/5] If more than 5 pieces of fruit fall off the screen without being sliced, the game ends.

Aesthetics & Gameplay (15%)
[13/15] Additional marks for compelling gameplay, smooth interaction, additional interesting visual elements or features.
