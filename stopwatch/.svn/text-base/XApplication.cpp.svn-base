     * queue and dispath them one by one.

     *   progresses (executes any scripts, accepts any user keyboard
     *   input) (already done for you)
     * - Check the return code for scheme_interpreter_service. If it
     *   returns a non-zero value, the application should quit
     * - You need to determine whether there are any events pending in
     *   X lib (call CheckForXEvents()). (already done for you) NOT
     * - You should call EventQueue's ProcessNextEvent() method to
     *   process events and service the timers. Note, you should call
     *   this *even if there are no events pending*, since it will
     *   service the timers.
     * - You'll need to flush X using XFlush() at some point so it
     *   actually communicates changes to the X server
     * - You should sleep if there is nothing left to do, so the app
     *   is not throttling the CPU. Before sleeping, make sure you
     *   check whether any X events are pending using XPending(). If
     *   there are, you shouldn't sleep.
     * - If you sleep, sleep for a very small amount of time, say
     *   1/1000 of a second, to enable interactive typing rates on the
     *   console. (See the usleep function for fine-grained sleep
     *   amounts).
     * - We *will* check to ensure your app doesn't throttle the CPU
     *   when idle, so make sure you sleep when there are no events.
