
CS349 ASSIGNMENT 1 MARKING SCHEME
MARKED BY: diane.watson (@uwaterloo.ca)

GUIDELINES
The assignment needs to compile and run in order for the TA to mark it. If it doesn't compile, but the TA is able to get it working, you will only lose marks for the "Compiles and runs" section. If they cannot get it to compile, you receive zero for the assignment.
